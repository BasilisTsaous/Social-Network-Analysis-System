The aim of the Diploma Thesis is to present the creation of an automated system, with which it will be possible to analyze and predict the personality, interests and preferences of users in Online Social Networks, through the use of necessary information from their profiles. 
Initially, the data published on the users' Facebook profiles are collected, from a public group called Cheltenham Facebook Groups, linear models are constructed, in order to calculate the level of trust between them, methods are created for predicting their personality characteristics, using the Big Five Personality model, as well as for determining their interests and preferences. 
Then, a Facebook scraper algorithm is established, which is used to extract the public data of users from a Facebook API. The collected data is applied to the input of a classifier, called Ada Boosted Decision Tree, which uses a data mining technique, in order to identify the personality characteristics of users and interests from their profile, combining their public data with their answers on the Big Five Personality Test and Young People Survey respectively.
The evaluation of the performance of the models shows that satisfactory accuracy is achieved in all cases, which certainly indicates the ability of the models to measure and predict with high success rates, the level of trust between users and the analysis of their social behavior in a network.
